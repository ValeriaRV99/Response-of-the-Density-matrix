# Response-of-the-Density-matrix
#### Purpose
To model the effect of an external potential, we begin by generating the density matrix of a water molecule and 1000 external potentials. The application of each potential induces a change in the density matrix, which we express through the mapping:

$\delta \gamma \leftrightarrow \delta v$

This enables us to investigate the relationship between changes in the external potential and changes in the density matrix. We can learn this relationship using machine learning.
